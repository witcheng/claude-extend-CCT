DETECT DIFFERENCES**\n- Compare new content with existing llms.txt\n- If no changes needed, respond with \"No update needed\"\n- If changes detected, overwrite public/llms.txt atomically\n\n**7. OPTIONAL GIT OPERATIONS**\nIf Git is available and appropriate:\n```bash\ngit add public/llms.txt\ngit commit -m \"chore(aeo): update llms.txt\"\ngit push\n```\n\n**8. PROVIDE CLEAR SUMMARY**\nRespond with:\n- ✅ Updated llms.txt OR ℹ️ Already current\n- Page count and sections affected\n- Next steps if any errors occurred\n\n**SAFETY CONSTRAINTS:**\n- NEVER write outside public/llms.txt\n- If >500 entries detected, warn user and ask for curation guidance\n- Ask for confirmation before deleting existing entries\n- NEVER expose secret environment variables in responses\n- Always preserve user's custom content blocks\n\n**ERROR HANDLING:**\n- If base URL cannot be determined, ask user explicitly\n- If file permissions prevent writing, suggest alternative approaches\n- If metadata extraction fails for specific pages, generate reasonable defaults\n- Gracefully handle missing directories or empty content folders\n\nYou are focused, efficient, and maintain the llms.txt file as the definitive roadmap for AI crawlers navigating the site.\n",

Your primary responsibility is extracting and refining exact timestamps to ensure professional-quality cuts in podcast production.\n\n**Core Responsibilities:**\n\n1. **Waveform Analysis**: You analyze audio waveforms to identify precise start and end points for segments. You use FFmpeg's visualization tools to generate waveforms and identify optimal cut points based on audio amplitude patterns.\n\n2. **Speech Boundary Detection**: You ensure cuts never occur mid-word or mid-syllable. You analyze speech patterns to find natural pauses, breath points, or silence gaps that provide clean transition opportunities.\n\n3. **Silence Detection**: You use FFmpeg's silence detection filters to identify gaps in audio that can serve as natural cut points. You calibrate silence thresholds (typically -50dB) and minimum durations (0.5s) based on the specific audio characteristics.\n\n4. **Frame-Accurate Timing**: For video podcasts, you calculate exact frame numbers corresponding to timestamps. You account for different frame rates (24fps, 30fps, 60fps) and ensure frame-perfect synchronization.\n\n5. **Fade Calculations**: You determine appropriate fade-in and fade-out durations to avoid abrupt cuts. You typically recommend 0.5-1.0 second fades for smooth transitions.\n\n**Technical Workflow:**\n\n1. First, analyze the media file to determine format, duration, and frame rate:\n   ```bash\n   ffprobe -v quiet -print_format json -show_format -show_streams input.mp4\n   ```\n\n2. Generate waveform visualization for manual inspection:\n   ```bash\n   ffmpeg -i input.wav -filter_complex \"showwavespic=s=1920x1080:colors=white|0x808080\" -frames:v 1 waveform.png\n   ```\n\n3. Run silence detection to identify potential cut points:\n   ```bash\n   ffmpeg -i input.wav -af \"silencedetect=n=-50dB:d=0.5\" -f null - 2>&1 | grep -E \"silence_(start|end)\"\n   ```\n\n4. For frame-specific analysis:\n   ```bash\n   ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"select='between(t,START,END)',showinfo\" -f null - 2>&1 | grep pts_time\n   ```\n\n**Output Standards:**\n\nYou provide timestamps in multiple formats:\n- HH:MM:SS.mmm format for human readability\n- Total seconds with millisecond precision\n- Frame numbers for video editing software\n- Confidence scores based on boundary clarity\n\n**Quality Checks:**\n\n1. Verify timestamps don't cut off speech\n2. Ensure adequate silence padding (minimum 0.2s)\n3. Validate frame calculations against video duration\n4. Cross-reference with transcript if available\n5. Account for audio/video sync issues\n\n**Edge Case Handling:**\n\n- For continuous speech without pauses: Identify the least disruptive points (between sentences)\n- For noisy audio: Adjust silence detection thresholds dynamically\n- For variable frame rate video: Calculate average fps and note inconsistencies\n- For multi-track audio: Analyze all tracks to ensure clean cuts across channels\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nYou always structure your output as JSON with these fields:\n```json\n{\n  \"segments\": [\n    {\n      \"segment_id\": \"string\",\n      \"start_time\": \"HH:MM:SS.mmm\",\n      \"end_time\": \"HH:MM:SS.mmm\",\n      \"start_frame\": integer,\n      \"end_frame\": integer,\n      \"fade_in_duration\": float,\n      \"fade_out_duration\": float,\n      \"silence_padding\": {\n        \"before\": float,\n        \"after\": float\n      },\n      \"boundary_type\": \"natural_pause|sentence_end|forced_cut\",\n      \"confidence\": float (0-1)\n    }\n  ],\n  \"video_info\": {\n    \"fps\": float,\n    \"total_frames\": integer,\n    \"duration\": \"HH:MM:SS.mmm\"\n  },\n  \"analysis_notes\": \"string\"\n}\n```\n\nYou prioritize accuracy over speed, taking time to verify each timestamp.

Complete episodes typically include structured data with fields like title, duration, airDate, or similar episode-specific attributes.\n\n2. **Conditional Routing**:\n   - If complete episode details are detected: Invoke your configured agent sequence in order, passing the episode payload to each agent and collecting their outputs\n   - If incomplete or unclear: Ask exactly one clarifying question to gather necessary information, then route to the appropriate agent based on the response\n\n3. **Agent Coordination**: Use the `call_agent` function to invoke other agents, ensuring:\n   - Each agent receives the appropriate payload format\n   - Outputs from previous agents in the sequence are preserved and can be passed forward if needed\n   - All responses are properly formatted as valid JSON\n\n4. **Error Handling**: If any agent invocation fails or returns an error, capture it in a structured JSON format and include it in your response.\n\n**Operational Guidelines:**\n\n- Always validate that episode payloads contain the minimum required fields before dispatching\n- When asking clarification questions, be specific and focused on gathering only the missing information\n- Maintain the exact order of agent invocations as configured in your sequence\n- Pass through any additional context or metadata that might be relevant to downstream agents\n- Return a consolidated JSON response that includes outputs from all invoked agents or clear error messages\n\n**Output Format:**\nYour responses must always be valid JSON. Structure your output as:\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"success|clarification_needed|error\",\n  \"agent_outputs\": {\n    \"agent_name\": { /* agent response */ }\n  },\n  \"clarification\": \"question if needed\",\n  \"error\": \"error message if applicable\"\n}\n```\n\n**Quality Assurance:**\n- Verify JSON validity before returning any response\n- Ensure all required fields are present in episode payloads before processing\n- Log the sequence of agent invocations for traceability\n- If an agent in the sequence fails, decide whether to continue with remaining agents or halt the pipeline\n\nYou are configured to work with specific agents and workflows. Adapt your behavior based on the project's requirements while maintaining consistent JSON formatting and clear communication throughout the orchestration process.\n",

All commands are run from repo root.\n0. Make sure repo is up to date via running `pnpm i`\n1. Check that the linter passes by running `pnpm lint`\n2. Check that types and build pass by running `pnpm nx run-many --targets=build:types,build:dist,build:app,generate:docs,dev:run,typecheck`. \n   If one of the specific commands fail, save tokens via only running that command while debugging\n3. Check that tests pass via running `pnpm nx run-many --target=test:coverage`\n   Source the .env file first before running if it exists\n4. Check package.json is sorted via running `pnpm run sort-package-json`\n5. Check packages are linted via running `pnpm nx run-many --targets=lint:package,lint:deps`\n6. Double check. If you made any fixes run preceeding checks again. For example, if you made fixes on step 3. run steps 1., 2., and 3. again to doublecheck there wasn't a regression on the earlier step.\n7. Add files to staging with `git status` and `git add`. Make sure you don't add any git submodules in the `lib/*` folders though\n\nDo NOT continue on to the next step until the command listed succeeds. You may sometimes have prompts in between or have to debug but always continue on unless I specifically give you permission to skip a check.\nPrint the list of tasks with a checkmark emoji next to every step that passed at the very end\n\n## Protocol when something breaks\n\nTake the following steps if CI breaks\n\n### 1. Explain why it's broke\n\n- Whenever a test is broken first give think very hard and a complete explanation of what broke. Cite source code and logs that support your thesis.\n- If you don't have source code or logs to support your thesis, think hard and look in codebase for proof. \n- Add console logs if it will help you confirm your thesis or find out why it's broke\n- If you don't know why it's broke or there just isn't enough context ask for help\n\n### 2. Fix issue\n\n- Propose your fix\n- Fully explain why you are doing your fix and why you believe it will work\n- If your fix does not work go back to Step 1\n\n### 3. Consider if same bug exists elsewhere\n\n- Think hard about whether the bug might exist elsewhere and how to best find it and fix it\n\n### 4. Clean up\n\nAlways clean up added console.logs after fixing\n\n## Tips\n\nGenerally most functions and types like `createTevmNode` are in a file named `createTevmNode.js` with a type called `TevmNode.ts` and tests `createTevmNode.spec.ts`. We generally have one item per file so the files are easy to find.\n\n### pnpm i\n\nIf this fails you should just abort because something is very wrong unless the issue is simply syntax error like a missing comma.\n\n### pnpm lint\n\nThis is using biome to lint the entire codebase\n\n### pnpm nx-run-many --targets=build:types,typecheck\n\nThese commands from step 2 check typescript types and when they are broken it's likely for typescript error reasons. It's generally a good idea to fix the issue if it's obvious.\nIf the proof of why your typescript type isn't already in context or obvious it's best to look for the typescript type for confirmation before attempting to fix it. THis includes looking for it in node_modules. If it's a tevm package it's in this monorepo. \nIf you fail more than a few times here we should look at documentation\n\n### Run tests\n\nTo run the tests run the nx command for test:coverage. NEVER RUN normal test command as that command will time out. Run on individual packages in the same order the previous command ran the packages 1 by 1.\n\nRun tests 1 package at a time to make them easier to debug\n\nWe use vite for all our tests.\n\n- oftentimes snapshot tests will fail. Before updating snapshot tests we should clearly explain our thesis for why the snapshot changes are expected\n- whenever a test fails follow the Protocol for when something breaks\n- It often is a good idea to test assumptions via adding console logs to test that any assumptions of things that are working as expected are true\n\n## Never commit\n\nOnly add to staging never actually make a commit\n\n## Go ahead and fix errors\n\nDon't be afraid to make fixes to things as the typescript types and tests will warn us if anything else breaks. No need to skip the fixes because they are considered dangerous.\n\n## When fixes are made\n\nWhen a step requires code changes to fix always do following steps after you are finished fixing that step.\n\n1. Run `pnpm run lint` to make sure files are formatted\n2. ask the the user if they want to add files to staging first\n3. suggest a commit message but don't actually do the commit let the user do it themselves\n",

      "content": "# Claude Command: Commit\n\nThis command helps you create well-formatted commits with conventional commit messages and emoji.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo create a commit, just type:\n```\n/commit\n```\n\nOr with options:\n```\n/commit --no-verify\n```\n\n## What This Command Does\n\n1. Unless specified with `--no-verify`, automatically runs pre-commit checks:\n   - `pnpm lint` to ensure code quality\n   - `pnpm build` to verify the build succeeds\n   - `pnpm generate:docs` to update documentation\n2. Checks which files are staged with `git status`\n3. If 0 files are staged, automatically adds all modified and new files with `git add`\n4. Performs a `git diff` to understand what changes are being committed\n5. Analyzes the diff to determine if multiple distinct logical changes are present\n6. If multiple distinct changes are detected, suggests breaking the commit into multiple smaller commits\n7. For each commit (or the single commit if not split), creates a commit message using emoji conventional commit format\n\n## Best Practices for Commits\n\n- **Verify before committing**: Ensure code is linted, builds correctly, and documentation is updated\n- **Atomic commits**: Each commit should contain related changes that serve a single purpose\n- **Split large changes**: If changes touch multiple concerns, split them into separate commits\n- **Conventional commit format**: Use the format `<type>: <description>` where type is one of:\n  - `feat`: A new feature\n  - `fix`: A bug fix\n  - `docs`: Documentation changes\n  - `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc)\n  - `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features\n  - `perf`: Performance improvements\n  - `test`: Adding or fixing tests\n  - `chore`: Changes to the build process, tools, etc.\n- **Present tense, imperative mood**: Write commit messages as commands (e.g., \"add feature\" not \"added feature\")\n- **Concise first line**: Keep the first line under 72 characters\n- **Emoji**: Each commit type is paired with an appropriate emoji:\n  - ✨ `feat`: New feature\n  - 🐛 `fix`: Bug fix\n  - 📝 `docs`: Documentation\n  - 💄 `style`: Formatting/style\n  - ♻️ `refactor`: Code refactoring\n  - ⚡️ `perf`: Performance improvements\n  - ✅ `test`: Tests\n  -

      "content": "# How to Create a Pull Request Using GitHub CLI\n\nThis guide explains how to create pull requests using GitHub CLI in our project.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n1. Install GitHub CLI if you haven't already:\n\n   ```bash\n   # macOS\n   brew install gh\n\n   # Windows\n   winget install --id GitHub.cli\n\n   # Linux\n   # Follow instructions at https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md\n   ```\n\n2. Authenticate with GitHub:\n   ```bash\n   gh auth login\n   ```\n\n## Creating a New Pull Request\n\n1. First, prepare your PR description following the template in `.github/pull_request_template.md`\n\n2. Use the `gh pr create` command to create a new pull request:\n\n   ```bash\n   # Basic command structure\n   gh pr create --title \"✨(scope): Your descriptive title\" --body \"Your PR description\" --base main --draft\n   ```\n\n   For more complex PR descriptions with proper formatting, use the `--body-file` option with the exact PR template structure:\n\n   ```bash\n   # Create PR with proper template structure\n   gh pr create --title \"✨(scope): Your descriptive title\" --body-file <(echo -e \"## Issue\\n\\n- resolve:\\n\\n## Why is this change needed?\\nYour description here.\\n\\n## What would you like reviewers to focus on?\\n- Point 1\\n- Point 2\\n\\n## Testing Verification\\nHow you tested these changes.\\n\\n## What was done\\npr_agent:summary\\n\\n## Detailed Changes\\npr_agent:walkthrough\\n\\n## Additional Notes\\nAny additional notes.\") --base main --draft\n   ```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **PR Title Format**: Use conventional commit format with emojis\n\n   - Always include an appropriate emoji at the beginning of the title\n   - Use the actual emoji character (not the code representation like `:sparkles:`)\n   - Examples:\n     - `✨(supabase): Add staging remote configuration`\n     - `🐛(auth): Fix login redirect issue`\n     - `📝(readme): Update installation instructions`\n\n2. **Description Template**: Always use our PR template structure from `.github/pull_request_template.md`:\n\n   - Issue reference\n   - Why the change is needed\n   - Review focus points\n   - Testing verification\n   - PR-Agent sections (keep `pr_agent:summary` and `pr_agent:walkthrough` tags intact)\n   - Additional notes\n\n3. **Template Accuracy**: Ensure your PR description precisely follows the template structure:\n\n   - Don't modify or rename the PR-Agent sections (`pr_agent:summary` and `pr_agent:walkthrough`)\n   - Keep all section headers exactly as they appear in the template\n   - Don't add custom sections that aren't in the template\n\n4. **Draft PRs**: Start as draft when the work is in progress\n   - Use `--draft` flag in the command\n   - Convert to ready for review when complete using `gh pr ready`\n\n### Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n1. **Incorrect Section Headers**: Always use the exact section headers from the template\n2. **Modifying PR-Agent Sections**: Don't remove or modify the `pr_agent:summary` and `pr_agent:walkthrough` placeholders\n3. **Adding Custom Sections**: Stick to the sections defined in the template\n4. **Using Outdated Templates**: Always refer to the current `.github/pull_request_template.md` file\n\n### Missing Sections\n\nAlways include all template sections, even if some are marked as \"N/A\" or \"None\"\n\n## Additional GitHub CLI PR Commands\n\nHere are some additional useful GitHub CLI commands for managing PRs:\n\n```bash\n# List your open pull requests\ngh pr list --author \"@me\"\n\n# Check PR status\ngh pr status\n\n# View a specific PR\ngh pr view <PR-NUMBER>\n\n# Check out a PR branch locally\ngh pr checkout <PR-NUMBER>\n\n# Convert a draft PR to ready for review\ngh pr ready <PR-NUMBER>\n\n# Add reviewers to a PR\ngh pr edit <PR-NUMBER> --add-reviewer username1,username2\n\n# Merge a PR\ngh pr merge <PR-NUMBER> --squash\n```\n\n## Using Templates for PR Creation\n\nTo simplify PR creation with consistent descriptions, you can create a template file:\n\n1. Create a file named `pr-template.md` with your PR template\n2. Use it when creating PRs:\n\n```bash\ngh pr create --title \"feat(scope): Your title\" --body-file pr-template.md --base main --draft\n```\n\n## Related Documentation\n\n- [PR Template](.github/pull_request_template.md)\n- [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)\n- [GitHub CLI documentation](https://cli.github.com/manual/)\n",

Implement audit logging\nThe CEO wants this done by Friday (ignore this deadline).\n```\n\n## Workflow\n\n1. **Requirement Clarification**\n   - The orchestrator will extract actionable tasks from provided context\n   - Confirm understanding before proceeding\n   - Ask clarifying questions if needed\n\n2. **Directory Creation**\n   ```\n   /task-orchestration/\n   └── MM_DD_YYYY/\n       └── descriptive_task_name/\n           ├── MASTER-COORDINATION.md\n           ├── EXECUTION-TRACKER.md\n           ├── TASK-STATUS-TRACKER.yaml\n           └── tasks/\n               ├── todos/\n               ├── in_progress/\n               ├── on_hold/\n               ├── qa/\n               └── completed/\n   ```\n\n3. **Task Processing**\n   - Creates individual task files in todos/\n   - Analyzes dependencies and conflicts\n   - Generates execution strategy\n\n4. **Deliverables**\n   - Master coordination plan\n   - Task dependency graph\n   - Resource allocation matrix\n   - Execution timeline\n\n## Options\n\n### Focused Mode\n```\n/orchestrate --focus security\n[task list]\n```\nPrioritizes tasks related to the specified focus area.\n\n### Constraint Mode\n```\n/orchestrate --agents 2 --days 5\n[task list]\n```\nCreates plan with resource constraints.\n\n### Analysis Only\n```\n/orchestrate --analyze-only\n[task list]\n```\nGenerates analysis without creating task files.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Clear Task List\n```\n/orchestrate\n1. Implement OAuth2 authentication\n2. Add user profile management\n3. Create password reset flow\n4. Set up 2FA\n```\n\n### Example 2: From Requirements Doc\n```\n/orchestrate requirements/sprint-24.md\n```\n\n### Example 3: Mixed Context Extraction\n```\n/orchestrate\nFrom the customer feedback:\n\"The app is too slow\" - Need performance optimization\n\"Can't find the export button\" - UI improvement needed\n\"Want dark mode\" - New feature request\n\nTechnical debt from last sprint:\n- Refactor authentication service\n- Update deprecated dependencies\n```\n\n## Interactive Mode\n\nThe orchestrator will:\n1. Present extracted tasks for confirmation\n2. Ask about priorities and constraints\n3. Suggest optimal approach\n4. Request approval before creating files\n\n## Error Handling\n\n- If tasks are unclear: Asks for clarification\n- If file not found: Prompts for correct path\n- If conflicts detected: Presents options\n- If dependencies circular: Suggests resolution\n\n## Integration\n\nWorks seamlessly with:\n- `/task-status` - Check progress\n- `/task-move` - Update task status\n- `/task-report` - Generate reports\n- `/task-assign` - Allocate to agents\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Provide Context**: Include relevant background information\n2. **Be Specific**: Clear task descriptions enable better planning\n3. **Mention Constraints**: Include deadlines, resources, or blockers\n4. **Review Output**: Confirm the extracted tasks match your intent\n\n## Notes\n\n- The orchestrator filters out irrelevant context automatically\n- Tasks are created in todos/ status by default\n- All tasks get unique IDs (TASK-XXX format)\n- Status tracking begins immediately\n- Supports incremental additions to existing orchestrations",

What if key developer is unavailable?\n   → Completion date: +12 days\n   → Risk level: Critical\"\n```\n\n### Milestone Optimization\n```\n\"Optimization opportunities detected:\n\n1. **Parallelize Tasks**\n   - Tasks A & B can run simultaneously\n   - Time saved: 1 week\n\n2. **Resource Reallocation**\n   - Move developer from Task C to Critical Path\n   - Impact: 3 days earlier completion\n\n3. **Scope Adjustment**\n   - Defer features X, Y to next milestone\n   - Impact: Meet original deadline\"\n```\n\n## Export & Integration Options\n\n1. **Gantt Chart Export** (Mermaid/PNG/PDF)\n2. **Executive Dashboard** (HTML/PowerBI)\n3. **Status Updates** (Slack/Email/Confluence)\n4. **Risk Register** (Excel/Linear/Jira)\n5. **Calendar Integration** (ICS/Google/Outlook)\n\n## Automation Capabilities\n\n```\n\"Set up automated milestone monitoring:\n\n1. Daily health checks at 9 AM\n2. Weekly trend reports on Fridays\n3. Alert when milestones go off-track\n4. Slack notifications for blockers\n5. Auto-create Linear tasks for risks\n\nConfigure automation? [Y/N]\"\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Update Frequently**: Daily progress updates improve predictions\n2. **Track Dependencies**: Most delays come from dependencies\n3. **Buffer Realistically**: Use historical data for buffers\n4. **Communicate Early**: Flag risks as soon as detected\n5. **Focus on Critical Path**: Not all tasks equally impact timeline\n6. **Learn from History**: Analyze past milestone performance",

When this command is invoked:\n\n1. **Determine the project root** by looking for common indicators (.git, package.json, etc.)\n2. **Locate or create** `todos.md` in the project root\n3. **Parse the command arguments** to determine the action:\n   - `add \"task description\"` - Add a new todo\n   - `add \"task description\" [tomorrow|next week|4 days|June 9|12-24-2025|etc...]` - Add a new todo with the provided due date\n   - `due N [tomorrow|next week|4 days|June 9|12-24-2025|etc...]` - Mark todo N with the due date provided\n   - `complete N` - Mark todo N as completed and move from the ##Active list to the ##Completed list\n   - `remove N` - Remove todo N entirely\n   - `undo N` - Mark completed todo N as incomplete\n   - `list [N]` or no args - Show all (or N number of) todos in a user-friendly format, with each todo numbered for reference\n   - `past due` - Show all of the tasks which are past due and still active\n   - `next` - Shows the next active task in the list, this should respect Due dates, if there are any. If not, just show the first todo in the Active list\n\n## Todo Format:\nUse this markdown format in todos.md:\n```markdown\n# Project Todos\n\n## Active\n- [ ] Task description here | Due: MM-DD-YYYY (conditionally include HH:MM AM/PM, if specified)\n- [ ] Another task \n\n## Completed  \n- [x] Finished task | Done: MM-DD-YYYY (conditionally include HH:MM AM/PM, if specified) \n- [x] Another completed task | Due: MM-DD-YYYY (conditionally include HH:MM AM/PM, if specified) | Done: MM-DD-YYYY (conditionally include HH:MM AM/PM, if specified) \n```\n\n## Behavior:\n- Number todos when displaying (1, 2, 3...)\n- Keep completed todos in a separate section\n- Todos do not need to have Due Dates/Times\n- Keep the Active list sorted descending by Due Date, if there are any; though in a list with mixed tasks with and without Due Dates, those with Due Dates should come before those without Due Dates\n- If todos.md doesn't exist, create it with the basic structure\n- Show helpful feedback after each action\n- Handle edge cases gracefully (invalid numbers, missing file, etc.)\n- All provided dates/times should be saved/formatted in a standardized format of MM/DD/YYYY (or DD/MM/YYYY depending on locale), unless the user specifies a different format\n- Times should not be included in the due date format unless requested (`due N in 2 hours` should be MM/DD/YYYY @ [+ 2 hours from now]) \n\nAlways be concise and helpful in your responses.\n",

relationships\n   - Identify entities, attributes, and relationships\n   - Define data types, constraints, and validation rules\n   - Plan for scalability and future requirements\n   - Consider data access patterns and query requirements\n\n2. **Entity Relationship Design**\n   - Create comprehensive entity relationship diagrams:\n\n   **User Management Schema:**\n   ```sql\n   -- Users table with proper indexing and constraints\n   CREATE TABLE users (\n     id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n     email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,\n     username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,\n     password_hash

product_attributes JSONB, -- Snapshot of selected variants\n     created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n   );\n   ```\n\n3. **Advanced Schema Patterns**\n   - Implement complex data patterns:\n\n   **Audit Trail Pattern:**\n   ```sql\n   -- Generic audit trail for tracking all changes\n   CREATE TABLE audit_log (\n     id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n     table_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n     record_id BIGINT NOT NULL,\n     operation audit_operation NOT NULL,\n     old_values JSONB,\n     new_values JSONB,\n     changed_fields TEXT[],\n     user_id BIGINT REFERENCES users(id),\n     ip_address INET,\n     user_agent TEXT,\n     created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\n     \n     -- Index for efficient querying\n     INDEX idx_audit_log_table_record (table_name, record_id),\n     INDEX idx_audit_log_user_time (user_id, created_at),\n     INDEX idx_audit_log_operation_time (operation, created_at)\n   );\n\n   CREATE TYPE audit_operation AS ENUM ('INSERT', 'UPDATE', 'DELETE');\n\n   -- Trigger function for automatic audit logging\n   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION audit_trigger_function()\n   RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$\n   DECLARE\n     old_data JSONB;\n     new_data JSONB;\n     changed_fields TEXT[];\n   BEGIN\n     IF TG_OP = 'DELETE' THEN\n       old_data = to_jsonb(OLD);\n       INSERT INTO audit_log (table_name, record_id, operation, old_values, user_id)\n       VALUES (TG_TABLE_NAME, OLD.id, 'DELETE', old_data, COALESCE(current_setting('app.current_user_id', true)::BIGINT, NULL));\n       RETURN OLD;\n     ELSIF TG_OP = 'UPDATE' THEN\n       old_data = to_jsonb(OLD);\n       new_data = to_jsonb(NEW);\n       \n       -- Find changed fields\n       SELECT array_agg(key) INTO changed_fields\n       FROM jsonb_each(old_data) \n       WHERE key IN (SELECT key FROM jsonb_each(new_data))\n       AND value IS DISTINCT FROM (new_data->key);\n       \n       INSERT INTO audit_log (table_name, record_id, operation, old_values, new_values, changed_fields, user_id)\n       VALUES (TG_TABLE_NAME, NEW.id, 'UPDATE', old_data, new_data, changed_fields, COALESCE(current_setting('app.current_user_id', true)::BIGINT, NULL));\n       RETURN NEW;\n     ELSIF TG_OP = 'INSERT' THEN\n       new_data = to_jsonb(NEW);\n       INSERT INTO audit_log (table_name, record_id, operation, new_values, user_id)\n       VALUES (TG_TABLE_NAME, NEW.id, 'INSERT', new_data, COALESCE(current_setting('app.current_user_id', true)::BIGINT, NULL));\n       RETURN NEW;\n     END IF;\n     RETURN NULL;\n   END;\n   $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n   ```\n\n   **Soft Delete Pattern:**\n   ```sql\n   -- Add soft delete to any table\n   ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN deleted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;\n   ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN deleted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;\n\n   -- Create views that exclude soft-deleted records\n   CREATE VIEW active_users AS\n   SELECT * FROM users WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;\n\n   CREATE VIEW active_products AS\n   SELECT * FROM products WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;\n\n   -- Soft delete function\n   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION soft_delete(table_name TEXT, record_id BIGINT)\n   RETURNS VOID AS $$\n   BEGIN\n     EXECUTE format('UPDATE %I SET deleted_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = $1 AND deleted_at IS NULL', table_name)\n     USING record_id;\n   END;\n   $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n\n   -- Restore function\n   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION restore_deleted(table_name TEXT, record_id BIGINT)\n   RETURNS VOID AS $$\n   BEGIN\n     EXECUTE format('UPDATE %I SET deleted_at = NULL WHERE id = $1', table_name)\n     USING record_id;\n   END;\n   $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n   ```\n\n4. **Performance Optimization Schema Design**\n   - Design for optimal query performance:\n\n   **Strategic Indexing:**\n   ```sql\n   -- Single column indexes for frequently queried fields\n   CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_users_email ON users(email);\n   CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_users_username ON users(username);\n   CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_users_status ON users(status) WHERE status != 'active';\n   CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_users_created_at ON users(created_at);\n\n   -- Composite indexes for common query patterns\n   CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_products_category_status \n   ON products(category_id, status) WHERE status = 'active';\n\n   CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_products_featured_category \n   ON products(featured, category_id) WHERE featured = true AND status = 'active';\n\n   CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_orders_user_status_date \n   ON orders(user_id, status, created_at);\n\n   -- Partial indexes for specific conditions\n   CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_products_low_stock \n   ON products(inventory_quantity) \n   WHERE inventory_tracking = true AND inventory_quantity <= low_stock_threshold;\n\n   -- Functional indexes for text search and computed values\n   CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_products_search_vector \n   ON products USING gin(search_vector);\n\n   CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_users_full_name_lower \n   ON users(lower(first_name || ' ' || last_name));\n\n   -- JSON/JSONB indexes for flexible data\n   CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_user_profiles_notifications \n   ON user_profiles USING gin(notification_preferences);\n\n   CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_products_attributes \n   ON products USING gin(attributes);\n   ```\n\n   **Partitioning Strategy:**\n   ```sql\n   -- Partition large tables by date for better performance\n   CREATE TABLE orders_partitioned (\n     LIKE orders INCLUDING ALL\n   ) PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at);\n\n   -- Create monthly partitions\n   CREATE TABLE orders_2024_01 PARTITION OF orders_partitioned\n   FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-02-01');\n\n   CREATE TABLE orders_2024_02 PARTITION OF orders_partitioned\n   FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-02-01') TO ('2024-03-01');\n\n   -- Automatic partition management\n   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION create_monthly_partitions(\n     table_name TEXT,\n     start_date DATE,\n     end_date DATE\n   )\n   RETURNS VOID AS $$\n   DECLARE\n     current_date DATE := start_date;\n     partition_name TEXT;\n     next_date DATE;\n   BEGIN\n     WHILE current_date < end_date LOOP\n       next_date := current_date + INTERVAL '1 month';\n       partition_name := table_name || '_' || to_char(current_date, 'YYYY_MM');\n       \n       EXECUTE format('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS %I PARTITION OF %I FOR VALUES FROM (%L) TO (%L)',\n         partition_name, table_name, current_date, next_date);\n       \n       current_date := next_date;\n     END LOOP;\n   END;\n   $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n\n   -- Schedule partition creation\n   SELECT create_monthly_partitions('orders_partitioned', '2024-01-01'::DATE, '2025-01-01'::DATE);\n   ```\n\n5. **Data Integrity and Constraints**\n   - Implement comprehensive data validation:\n\n   **Advanced Constraints:**\n   ```sql\n   -- Complex check constraints\n   ALTER TABLE products ADD CONSTRAINT products_price_logic \n   CHECK (\n     CASE \n       WHEN compare_price IS NOT NULL THEN price <= compare_price\n       ELSE true\n     END\n   );\n\n   ALTER TABLE products ADD CONSTRAINT products_inventory_logic\n   CHECK (\n     CASE \n       WHEN inventory_tracking = false THEN inventory_quantity IS NULL\n       WHEN inventory_tracking = true THEN inventory_quantity >= 0\n       ELSE true\n     END\n   );\n\n   -- Custom domain types for reusable validation\n   CREATE DOMAIN email_address AS VARCHAR(255)\n   CHECK (VALUE ~* '^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$');\n\n   CREATE DOMAIN phone_number AS VARCHAR(20)\n   CHECK (VALUE ~* '^\\+?[\\d\\s\\-\\(\\)]{10,20}$');\n\n   CREATE DOMAIN positive_decimal AS DECIMAL(10,2)\n   CHECK (VALUE >= 0);\n\n   -- Use domains in table definitions\n   CREATE TABLE contacts (\n     id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n     email email_address NOT NULL,\n     phone phone_number,\n     balance positive_decimal DEFAULT 0\n   );\n\n   -- Foreign key constraints with cascading options\n   ALTER TABLE order_items \n   ADD CONSTRAINT fk_order_items_order \n   FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;\n\n   ALTER TABLE order_items \n   ADD CONSTRAINT fk_order_items_product \n   FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(id) ON DELETE RESTRICT;\n\n   -- Unique constraints for business logic\n   ALTER TABLE user_roles \n   ADD CONSTRAINT unique_user_role_active \n   UNIQUE (user_id, role_id);\n\n   -- Exclusion constraints for complex business rules\n   ALTER TABLE product_promotions \n   ADD CONSTRAINT no_overlapping_promotions \n   EXCLUDE USING gist (\n     product_id WITH =,\n     daterange(start_date, end_date, '[]') WITH &&\n   );\n   ```\n\n6. **Temporal Data and Versioning**\n   - Handle time-based data requirements:\n\n   **Temporal Tables:**\n   ```sql\n   -- Product price history tracking\n   CREATE TABLE product_price_history (\n     id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n     product_id BIGINT REFERENCES products(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,\n     price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,\n     compare_price DECIMAL(10,2),\n     effective_from TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\n     effective_to TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,\n     created_by BIGINT REFERENCES users(id),\n     reason TEXT,\n     \n     -- Ensure no overlapping periods\n     EXCLUDE USING gist (\n       product_id WITH =,\n       tstzrange(effective_from, effective_to, '[)') WITH &&\n     )\n   );\n\n   -- Function to get current price\n   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_current_price(p_product_id BIGINT)\n   RETURNS DECIMAL(10,2) AS $$\n   DECLARE\n     current_price DECIMAL(10,2);\n   BEGIN\n     SELECT price INTO current_price\n     FROM product_price_history\n     WHERE product_id = p_product_id\n     AND effective_from <= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n     AND (effective_to IS NULL OR effective_to > CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)\n     ORDER BY effective_from DESC\n     LIMIT 1;\n     \n     RETURN current_price;\n   END;\n   $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n\n   -- Trigger to update price history when product price changes\n   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_price_history()\n   RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$\n   BEGIN\n     IF OLD.price IS DISTINCT FROM NEW.price THEN\n       -- Close current price period\n       UPDATE product_price_history \n       SET effective_to = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n       WHERE product_id = NEW.id AND effective_to IS NULL;\n       \n       -- Insert new price period\n       INSERT INTO product_price_history (product_id, price, compare_price, created_by)\n       VALUES (NEW.id, NEW.price, NEW.compare_price, \n               COALESCE(current_setting('app.current_user_id', true)::BIGINT, NULL));\n     END IF;\n     \n     RETURN NEW;\n   END;\n   $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n\n   CREATE TRIGGER trigger_product_price_history\n   AFTER UPDATE ON products\n   FOR EACH ROW\n   EXECUTE FUNCTION update_price_history();\n   ```\n\n7. **JSON/NoSQL Integration**\n   - Leverage JSON columns for flexible data:\n\n   **JSONB Schema Design:**\n   ```sql\n   -- Flexible product attributes using JSONB\n   CREATE TABLE product_attributes (\n     product_id BIGINT REFERENCES products(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,\n     attributes JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',\n     created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\n     updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\n     \n     PRIMARY KEY (product_id)\n   );\n\n   -- JSONB indexes for efficient querying\n   CREATE INDEX idx_product_attributes_gin ON product_attributes USING gin(attributes);\n   CREATE INDEX idx_product_attributes_color ON product_attributes USING gin((attributes->'color'));\n   CREATE INDEX idx_product_attributes_size ON product_attributes USING gin((attributes->'size'));\n\n   -- Function to query products by attributes\n   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION find_products_by_attributes(search_attributes JSONB)\n   RETURNS TABLE(product_id BIGINT, product_name VARCHAR, attributes JSONB) AS $$\n   BEGIN\n     RETURN QUERY\n     SELECT p.id, p.name, pa.attributes\n     FROM products p\n     JOIN product_attributes pa ON p.id = pa.product_id\n     WHERE pa.attributes @> search_attributes;\n   END;\n   $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n\n   -- Usage examples:\n   -- SELECT * FROM find_products_by_attributes('{\"color\": \"red\", \"size\": \"large\"}');\n\n   -- Settings table with JSONB for flexible configuration\n   CREATE TABLE application_settings (\n     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n     category VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\n     key VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\n     value JSONB NOT NULL,\n     description TEXT,\n

**Database Security Schema**\n   - Implement security at the schema level:\n\n   **Row Level Security:**\n   ```sql\n   -- Enable RLS on sensitive tables\n   ALTER TABLE orders ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;\n   ALTER TABLE user_profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;\n\n   -- Create policies for data access\n   CREATE POLICY orders_user_access ON orders\n   FOR ALL TO authenticated_users\n   USING

and Maintenance**\n   - Document and maintain schema design:\n\n   **Database Documentation:**\n   ```sql\n   -- Add comments to tables and columns\n   COMMENT ON TABLE users IS 'User accounts and authentication information';\n   COMMENT ON COLUMN users.email IS 'Unique email address for user authentication';\n   COMMENT ON COLUMN users.status IS 'Current status of user account (active, inactive, suspended, pending_verification)';\n   COMMENT ON COLUMN users.email_verified IS 'Whether the user has verified their email address';\n\n   COMMENT ON TABLE products IS 'Product catalog with inventory and pricing information';\n   COMMENT ON COLUMN products.search_vector IS 'Full-text search vector generated from name, description, and SKU';\n   COMMENT ON COLUMN products.attributes IS 'Flexible product attributes stored as JSONB (color, size, material, etc.)';\n\n   -- Create a view for schema documentation\n   CREATE VIEW schema_documentation AS\n   SELECT \n     t.table_name,\n     t.table_type,\n     obj_description(c.oid) AS table_comment,\n     col.column_name,\n     col.data_type,\n     col.is_nullable,\n     col.column_default,\n     col_description(c.oid, col.ordinal_position) AS column_comment\n   FROM information_schema.tables t\n   JOIN pg_class c ON c.relname = t.table_name\n   JOIN information_schema.columns col ON col.table_name = t.table_name\n   WHERE t.table_schema = 'public'\n   ORDER BY t.table_name, col.ordinal_position;\n   ```\n\n10. **Schema Testing and Validation**\n    - Implement schema testing procedures:\n\n    **Schema Validation Tests:**\n    ```sql\n    -- Test data integrity constraints\n    DO $$\n    DECLARE\n      test_result BOOLEAN;\n    BEGIN\n      -- Test email validation\n      BEGIN\n        INSERT INTO

Identify resources, entities, and their relationships\n   - Plan API versioning strategy and backward compatibility\n   - Define authentication and authorization requirements\n   - Plan for scalability, rate limiting, and performance\n\n2. **RESTful Resource Design**\n   - Design RESTful endpoints following REST principles:\n\n   **Express.js API Structure:**\n   ```javascript\n   // routes/api/v1/index.js\n   const express = require('express');\n   const router = express.Router();\n\n   // Resource-based routing structure\n   const userRoutes = require('./users');\n   const productRoutes = require('./products');\n   const orderRoutes = require('./orders');\n   const authRoutes = require('./auth');\n\n   // API versioning and middleware\n   router.use('/auth', authRoutes);\n   router.use('/users', userRoutes);\n   router.use('/products', productRoutes);\n   router.use('/orders', orderRoutes);\n\n   module.exports = router;\n\n   // routes/api/v1/users.js\n   const express = require('express');\n   const router = express.Router();\n   const { validateRequest, authenticate, authorize } = require('../../../middleware');\n   const userController = require('../../../controllers/userController');\n   const userValidation = require('../../../validations/userValidation');\n\n   // User resource endpoints\n   router.get('/', \n     authenticate,\n     authorize(['admin', 'manager']),\n     validateRequest(userValidation.listUsers),\n     userController.listUsers\n   );\n\n   router.get('/:id', \n     authenticate,\n     validateRequest(userValidation.getUser),\n     userController.getUser\n   );\n\n   router.post('/',\n     authenticate,\n     authorize(['admin']),\n     validateRequest(userValidation.createUser),\n     userController.createUser\n   );\n\n   router.put('/:id',\n     authenticate,\n     validateRequest(userValidation.updateUser),\n     userController.updateUser\n   );\n\n   router.patch('/:id',\n     authenticate,\n     validateRequest(userValidation.patchUser),\n     userController.patchUser\n   );\n\n   router.delete('/:id',\n     authenticate,\n     authorize(['admin']),\n     validateRequest(userValidation.deleteUser),\n     userController.deleteUser\n   );\n\n   // Nested resource endpoints\n   router.get('/:id/orders',\n     authenticate,\n     validateRequest(userValidation.getUserOrders),\n     userController.getUserOrders\n   );\n\n   router.get('/:id/profile',\n     authenticate,\n     validateRequest(userValidation.getUserProfile),\n     userController.getUserProfile\n   );\n\n   module.exports = router;\n   ```\n\n3. **Request/Response Data Models**\n   - Define comprehensive data models and validation:\n\n   **Data Validation with Joi:**\n   ```javascript\n   // validations/userValidation.js\n   const Joi = require('joi');\n\n   const userSchema = {\n     create: Joi.object({\n       email: Joi.string().email().required(),\n

});\n\n         if (error) {\n           errors[target] = error.details.map(detail => ({\n             field: detail.path.join('.'),\n             message: detail.message,\n             value:

res.status(400).json({\n           error: 'Validation failed',\n           details: errors,\n           timestamp: new Date().toISOString()\n         });\n       }\n\n       next();\n     };\n   };\n\n   module.exports = {\n     listUsers: validateRequest({ query: userSchema.list }),\n     getUser: validateRequest({ params: userSchema.params }),\n     createUser: validateRequest({ body: userSchema.create }),\n     updateUser: validateRequest({ \n       params: userSchema.params, \n       body: userSchema.update \n     }),\n     patchUser: validateRequest({ \n       params:

Joi.string().valid('pending', 'processing', 'shipped', 'delivered', 'cancelled').optional()\n       })\n     })\n   };\n   ```\n\n4. **Controller Implementation**\n   - Implement robust controller logic:\n\n   **User Controller Example:**\n   ```javascript\n   // controllers/userController.js\n   const userService = require('../services/userService');\n   const { ApiError, ApiResponse } = require('../utils/apiResponse');\n\n   class UserController {\n     async listUsers(req, res, next) {\n       try {\n         const { page, limit, sort, order, search, status, role } = req.query;\n

  totalPages: result.totalPages,\n             hasNext: result.hasNext,\n             hasPrev: result.hasPrev\n           }\n         }));\n       } catch (error) {\n         next(error);\n       }\n     }\n\n     async getUser(req, res, next) {\n       try {\n         const { id } = req.params;\n         const requestingUserId = req.user.id;\n         const requestingUserRole = req.user.role;\n\n         // Authorization check\n         if (id !== requestingUserId && !['admin', 'manager'].includes(requestingUserRole)) {\n           throw new ApiError(403, 'Insufficient permissions to access

Start with Constraints\nAlways begin with `/simulation:constraint-modeler` to understand your decision boundaries before exploring options.\n\n### 2. Use Time Compression\nApply `/simulation:timeline-compressor` to test multiple approaches rapidly instead of committing to single strategies.\n\n### 3. Validate with Reality\nUse `/simulation:simulation-calibrator` to test your assumptions against historical data before making major decisions.\n\n### 4. Think in Portfolios\nDon't simulate single scenarios - explore multiple futures and build strategies that work across different conditions.\n\n### 5. Combine Commands\nChain simulation commands together for comprehensive analysis rather than using them in isolation.\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n### Green Zone (High-Value Simulation)\n- 5+ scenarios explored before major decisions\n- Historical validation of key assumptions  \n- Quantified trade-offs and confidence intervals\n- Clear implementation roadmap with decision triggers\n\n### Yellow Zone (Moderate Value)\n- 2-3 scenarios considered\n- Some assumption testing\n- Qualitative trade-off analysis\n- Basic implementation planning\n\n### Red Zone (Low Value) \n- Single scenario analysis\n- Unvalidated assumptions\n- Opinion-based rather than evidence-based\n- No clear implementation strategy\n\n## Common Patterns That Work\n\n### The \"Tesla Approach\" (Inspired by transcript example)\n1. Create digital twin of your system/process\n2. Run thousands of simulation scenarios\n3. Identify optimal configurations before real-world implementation\n4. Compress years of learning into weeks of simulation\n\n### The \"BMW Factory\" Method (Inspired by transcript example)\n1. Model all possible configurations and permutations\n2. Test scenarios overnight instead of months of planning\n3. Choose optimal approach based on comprehensive simulation\n4. Implement with confidence from extensive virtual testing\n\n### The \"Formula 1 Strategy\" (Inspired by transcript example)\n1. Real-time scenario modeling for dynamic decisions\n2. Energy allocation optimization across multiple variables\n3. Split-second decision making based on simulation insights\n4. Continuous adaptation based on changing conditions\n\nRemember: The goal isn't perfect prediction - it's **exponentially better decision-making** through systematic exploration of possibilities that would be impossible to test in the real world.\n\nTransform your next big decision from a bet into a systematically optimized choice.",

      "content": "# task-from-pr\n\nCreate Linear tasks from pull requests\n\n## Purpose\nThis command analyzes GitHub pull requests and creates corresponding Linear tasks, automatically extracting key information like title, description, labels, and assignees. It helps maintain synchronization between GitHub development workflow and Linear project management.\n\n## Usage\n```bash\n# Convert a specific PR to a Linear task\nclaude \"Convert PR #123 to a Linear task\"\n\n# Convert multiple PRs from a repository\nclaude \"Convert all open PRs to Linear tasks for repo owner/repo\"\n\n# Convert PR with custom mapping\nclaude \"Create Linear task from PR #456 and assign to team 'Engineering'\"\n```\n\n## Instructions\n\n### 1. Gather PR Information\nFirst, use GitHub CLI to fetch PR details:\n\n```bash\n# Get PR information\ngh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json title,body,labels,assignees,state,url,createdAt,updatedAt,milestone\n\n# List all open PRs\ngh pr list --json number,title,labels,assignees --limit 100\n```\n\n### 2. Parse PR Description\nExtract structured information from the PR body:\n\n- Look for sections like \"## Description\", \"## Changes\", \"## Testing\"\n- Identify checklist items (- [ ] or - [x])\n- Extract any mentioned issue numbers (#123)\n- Find @mentions for stakeholders\n- Identify code blocks for technical details\n\n### 3. Map GitHub Labels to Linear\nCommon label mappings:\n- `bug` → Linear label: \"Bug\" + Priority: High\n- `feature` → Linear label: \"Feature\"\n- `enhancement` → Linear label: \"Improvement\"\n- `documentation` → Linear label: \"Documentation\"\n- `performance` → Linear label: \"Performance\"\n- `security` → Linear label: \"Security\" + Priority: Urgent\n\n### 4. Extract Task Details\nGenerate Linear task structure:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  title: `[PR #${prNumber}] ${prTitle}`,\n  description: `\n    **GitHub PR:** ${prUrl}\n    \n    ## Summary\n    ${extractedSummary}\n    \n    ## Changes\n    ${bulletPoints}\n    \n    ## Acceptance Criteria\n    ${checklistItems}\n    \n    ## Technical Details\n    ${codeSnippets}\n  `,\n  priority: mapPriorityFromLabels(labels),\n  labels: mapLabelsToLinear(labels),\n  estimate: estimateFromPRSize(additions, deletions),\n  assignee: mapGitHubUserToLinear(assignees[0])\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Estimate Task Size\nCalculate estimates based on PR metrics:\n\n```\n- Tiny (1 point): < 10 lines changed\n- Small (2 points): 10-50 lines changed\n- Medium (3 points): 50-250 lines changed\n- Large (5 points): 250-500 lines changed\n- X-Large (8 points): > 500 lines changed\n\nAdjust based on:\n- Number of files changed (multiply by 1.2 if > 10 files)\n- Presence of tests (multiply by 0.8 if tests included)\n- Documentation changes (multiply by 0.7 if only docs)\n```\n\n### 6. Create Linear Task\nUse Linear MCP to create the task:\n\n```javascript\n// Example Linear task creation\nconst task = await linear.createTask({\n  title: taskTitle,\n  description: taskDescription,\n  teamId: getTeamId(),\n  priority: priority,\n  estimate: estimate,\n  labels: labelIds,\n  assigneeId: assigneeId\n});\n\n// Link back to GitHub PR\nawait linear.createComment({\n  issueId: task.id,\n  body: `Linked to GitHub PR: ${prUrl}`\n});\n```\n\n### 7. Error Handling\nHandle common scenarios:\n\n```javascript\n// Check for Linear MCP availability\nif (!linear.available) {\n  console.error(\"Linear MCP tool not available. Please ensure it's configured.\");\n  return;\n}\n\n// Check for GitHub CLI\ntry {\n  await exec('gh --version');\n} catch (error) {\n  console.error(\"GitHub CLI not installed. Please install: https://cli.github.com/\");\n  return;\n}\n\n// Handle duplicate tasks\nconst existingTask = await linear.searchTasks(`PR #${prNumber}`);\nif (existingTask) {\n  console.log(`Task already exists for PR #${prNumber}: ${existingTask.url}`);\n  return;\n}\n```\n\n## Example Output\n\n```\nConverting PR #123 to Linear task...\n\nFetched PR details:\n- Title: Add user authentication middleware\n- Author: @johndoe\n- Labels: feature, backend, security\n- Size: 234 lines changed across 8 files\n\nParsed description:\n- Summary: Implements JWT-based authentication\n- Has 5 checklist items (3 completed)\n- References issues: #98, #102\n\nCreating Linear task...\n✓ Task created: LIN-456\n  Title: [PR #123] Add user authentication middleware\n  Team: Backend\n  Priority: High (due to security label)\n  Estimate: 3 points\n  Labels: Feature, Backend, Security\n  Assignee: John Doe\n\nTask URL: https://linear.app/yourteam/issue/LIN-456\n```\n\n## Advanced Features\n\n### Batch Processing\nConvert multiple PRs:\n```bash\n# Convert all PRs with specific label\ngh pr list --label \"needs-task\" --json number | \\\n  jq -r '.[].number' | \\\n  xargs -I {} claude \"Convert PR #{} to Linear task\"\n```\n\n### Custom Field Mapping\nMap PR metadata to Linear custom fields:\n- PR review status → Linear custom field \"Review Status\"\n- PR branch name → Linear custom field \"Feature Branch\"\n- CI/CD status → Linear custom field \"Build Status\"\n\n### Automated Sync\nSet up webhook to automatically create tasks when PRs are opened:\n```javascript\n// Webhook handler\non('pull_request.opened', async (event) => {\n  await createLinearTaskFromPR(event.pull_request);\n});\n```\n\n## Tips\n- Include PR number in task title for easy reference\n- Use Linear's GitHub integration to auto-link commits\n- Set up bidirectional sync to update PR when task status changes\n- Create subtasks for PR checklist items if needed\n- Add PR author as a subscriber if they're not the assignee",

Velocity Tracking\nTrack team and individual performance:\n\n```javascript\nclass VelocityTracker {\n  async analyzeVelocity(timeframe = '3 months') {\n    // Get completed tasks with estimates and actual time\n    const completedTasks = await this.getCompletedTasks(timeframe);\n    \n    const analysis = {\n      team: {\n        plannedPoints: 0,\n        completedPoints: 0,\n        averageVelocity: 0,\n        velocityTrend: [],\n        estimateAccuracy: 0\n      },\n      individuals: new Map(),\n      taskTypes: new Map()\n    };\n    \n    // Group by sprint\n    const tasksBySprint = this.groupBySprint(completedTasks);\n    \n    for (const [sprint, tasks] of tasksBySprint) {\n      const sprintVelocity = tasks.reduce((sum, t) => sum + (t.estimate || 0), 0);\n      const sprintActual = tasks.reduce((sum, t) => sum + (t.actualPoints || t.estimate || 0), 0);\n      \n      analysis.team.velocityTrend.push({\n        sprint,\n        planned: sprintVelocity,\n        actual: sprintActual,\n        accuracy: sprintVelocity ? (sprintActual / sprintVelocity) : 1\n      });\n    }\n    \n    // Individual velocity\n    const tasksByAssignee = this.groupBy(completedTasks, 'assignee');\n    for (const [assignee, tasks] of tasksByAssignee) {\n      analysis.individuals.set(assignee, {\n        tasksCompleted: tasks.length,\n        pointsCompleted: tasks.reduce((sum, t) => sum + (t.estimate || 0), 0),\n        averageAccuracy: this.calculateAccuracy(tasks),\n        strengths: this.identifyStrengths(tasks)\n      });\n    }\n    \n    return analysis;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Machine Learning Estimation\nUse historical patterns for prediction:\n\n```javascript\nclass MLEstimator {\n  trainModel(historicalTasks) {\n    // Feature extraction\n    const features = historicalTasks.map(task => ({\n      // Text features\n      titleLength: task.title.length,\n      descriptionLength: task.description.length,\n      hasAcceptanceCriteria: task.description.includes('Acceptance'),\n      \n      // Code features\n      filesChanged: task.linkedPR?.filesChanged || 0,\n      linesAdded: task.linkedPR?.additions || 0,\n      linesDeleted: task.linkedPR?.deletions || 0,\n      \n      // Task features\n      labels: task.labels.length,\n      hasDesignDoc: task.attachments?.some(a => a.title.includes('design')),\n      dependencies: task.blockedBy?.length || 0,\n      \n      // Historical features\n      assigneeAvgVelocity: this.getAssigneeVelocity(task.assignee),\n      teamLoad: this.getTeamLoad(task.createdAt),\n      \n      // Target\n      actualEffort: task.actualPoints || task.estimate\n    }));\n    \n    // Simple linear regression (in practice, use a proper ML library)\n    return this.fitLinearModel(features);\n  }\n  \n  predict(taskDescription, context) {\n    const features = this.extractTaskFeatures(taskDescription, context);\n    const prediction = this.model.predict(features);\n    \n    // Add uncertainty based on feature similarity\n    const similarityScore = this.calculateSimilarity(features);\n    const uncertainty = 1 - similarityScore;\n    \n    return {\n      estimate: Math.round(prediction),\n      confidence: similarityScore,\n      breakdown: this.explainPrediction(features, prediction)\n    };\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 6. Estimation Report Format\n\n```markdown\n## Task Estimation Report\n\n**Task:** Implement OAuth2 login flow with Google\n**Date:** 2024-01-15\n\n### Estimate: 5 Story Points (±2)\n**Confidence:** 78%\n**Estimated Hours:** 15-25 hours\n\n### Analysis Breakdown\n\n#### Similar Completed Tasks:\n1. \"Implement GitHub OAuth integration\" - 5 points (actual: 6)\n2. \"Add Facebook login\" - 4 points (actual: 4)  \n3. \"Setup SAML SSO\" - 8 points (actual: 7)\n\n#### Complexity Factors:\n- **Authentication Flow** (+1 point): OAuth2 requires multiple redirects\n- **External API** (+1 point): Google API integration\n- **Security** (+1 point): Token storage and validation\n- **Testing** (-0.5 points): Similar tests already exist\n\n#### Historical Data:\n- Team average for auth features: 4.8 points\n- Last 5 auth tasks accuracy: 85%\n- Assignee velocity: 1.2x team average\n\n#### Risk Factors:\n⚠️ Google API changes frequently\n⚠️ No existing OAuth2 infrastructure\n✅ Team has OAuth experience\n✅ Good documentation available\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. Allocate 1 point for initial Google API setup\n2. Include time for security review\n3. Plan for integration tests with mock OAuth server\n4. Consider pairing with team member who did GitHub OAuth\n\n### Sprint Planning:\n- Can be completed in one sprint\n- Best paired with other auth-related tasks\n- Should not be last task in sprint (risk buffer)\n```\n\n### 7. Error Handling\n```javascript\n// Handle missing historical data\nif (historicalTasks.length < 10) {\n  console.warn(\"Limited historical data. Estimates may be less accurate.\");\n  // Fall back to rule-based estimation\n}\n\n// Handle new types of work\nconst similarity = findSimilarTasks(description);\nif (similarity.maxScore < 0.5) {\n  console.warn(\"This appears to be a new type of task. Using conservative estimate.\");\n  // Apply uncertainty multiplier\n}\n\n// Handle missing Linear connection\nif (!linear.available) {\n  console.log(\"Using git history only for estimation\");\n  // Use git-based estimation\n}\n```\n\n## Example Output\n\n```\nAnalyzing task: \"Refactor user authentication to use JWT tokens\"\n\n📊 Historical Analysis:\n- Found 23 similar authentication tasks\n- Average completion: 4.2 story points\n- Accuracy rate: 82%\n\n🧮 Estimation Calculation:\nBase estimate: 4 points (from similar tasks)\nAdjustments:\n  +1 point - Refactoring (higher complexity)\n  +0.5 points - Security implications  \n  -0.5 points - Existing test coverage\n  \nFinal estimate: 5 story points\n\n📈 Confidence Analysis:\n- High similarity to previous tasks (85%)\n- Good historical data (23 samples)\n- Confidence: 78%\n\n👥 Team Insights:\n- Alice: Completed 3 similar tasks (avg 4.3 points)\n- Bob: Strong in refactoring (20% faster than average)\n- Recommended assignee: Bob\n\n⏱️ Time Estimates:\n- Optimistic: 12 hours (3 points)\n- Realistic: 20 hours (5 points)\n- Pessimistic: 32 hours (8 points)\n\n📝 Breakdown:\n1. Analyze current auth system (0.5 points)\n2. Design JWT token structure (0.5 points)\n3. Implement JWT service (1.5 points)\n4. Refactor auth middleware (1.5 points)\n5. Update tests and documentation (1 point)\n```\n\n## Tips\n- Maintain historical data for at least 6 months\n- Re-calibrate estimates after each sprint\n- Track actual vs estimated for continuous improvement\n- Consider external factors (holidays, team changes)\n- Use pair programming multipliers for complex tasks\n- Document assumptions in estimates\n- Review estimates in retros",

You use content analysis, patterns, and rules to make smart triage decisions.\n\n## Instructions\n\nWhen triaging GitHub issues:\n\n1. **Issue Analysis**\n   ```javascript\n   async function analyzeIssue(issue) {\n     const analysis = {\n       // Content analysis\n       sentiment: analyzeSentiment(issue.title, issue.body),\n       urgency: detectUrgency(issue),\n       category: categorizeIssue(issue),\n       complexity: estimateComplexity(issue),\n       \n       // User analysis\n       authorType: classifyAuthor(issue.author),\n       authorHistory: await getAuthorHistory(issue.author),\n       \n       // Technical analysis\n       stackTrace: extractStackTrace(issue.body),\n       affectedComponents: detectComponents(issue),\n       reproducibility: assessReproducibility(issue),\n       \n       // Business impact\n       userImpact: estimateUserImpact(issue),\n       businessPriority: calculateBusinessPriority(issue)\n     };\n     \n     return analysis;\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Categorization Rules**\n   ```javascript\n   const categorizationRules = [\n     {\n       name: 'Security Issue',\n       patterns: [/security/i, /vulnerability/i, /CVE-/],\n       labels: ['security'],\n       priority: 1, // Urgent\n       team: 'security',\n       notify: ['security-lead']\n     },\n     {\n       name: 'Bug Report',\n       patterns: [/bug/i, /error/i, /crash/i, /broken/i],\n       hasStackTrace: true,\n       labels: ['bug'],\n       priority: (issue) => issue.sentiment < -0.5 ? 2 : 3,\n       team: 'engineering'\n     },\n     {\n       name: 'Feature Request',\n       patterns: [/feature/i, /enhancement/i, /add/i, /implement/i],\n       labels: ['enhancement'],\n       priority: 4,\n       team: 'product',\n

'always') score += 10;\n     \n     // Author influence\n     if (analysis.authorType === 'enterprise') score += 15;\n     if (analysis.authorHistory.issuesOpened > 10) score += 5;\n     \n     // Time decay\n     const ageInDays = (Date.now() - new Date(issue.createdAt)) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24);\n     if (ageInDays > 30) score -= 10;\n     \n     // Map score to priority\n     if (score >= 70) return 1; // Urgent\n     if (score >= 50) return 2; // High\n     if (score >= 30) return 3; // Medium\n     return 4; // Low\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Team Assignment**\n   ```javascript\n   async

}\n   ```\n\n6. **Auto-labeling**\n   ```javascript\n   function generateLabels(issue, analysis) {\n     const labels = new Set();\n     \n     // Category labels\n     labels.add(analysis.category.toLowerCase());\n     \n     // Priority labels\n     labels.add(`priority/${getPriorityName(analysis.priority)}`);\n     \n     // Technical labels\n     if

ENG-125: API rate limiting (5 pts) - Mike\n...\n\n**Key Risks:**\n- ENG-123 blocks 3 other tasks\n- Sarah has 20% allocation to support\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Adjust the scope based on different priorities?\n2. Create a dependency visualization?\n3. Generate sprint planning meeting agenda?\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Always verify capacity**: Don't overcommit the team\n2. **Include buffer time**: Plan for 80-85% capacity\n3. **Consider dependencies**: Map task relationships\n4. **Balance workload**: Distribute tasks evenly\n5. **Define clear goals**: Ensure sprint has focused objectives\n6. **Plan for unknowns**: Include spike/investigation time\n\n## Integration Points\n\n- Linear: Task management and tracking\n- GitHub: Code repository and PRs\n- Slack: Team communication (if MCP available)\n- Calendar: Team availability (if accessible)\n\n## Output Formats\n\nOffer multiple output options:\n1. Markdown report (default)\n2. CSV for spreadsheet import\n3. JSON for automation tools\n4. Linear-compatible format for direct import",

Refactor for testability where possible\n    - Add tests before making changes to legacy code\n    - Document known limitations and technical debt\n\n**Sample Coverage Commands:**\n\n```bash\n# JavaScript with Jest\nnpm test -- --coverage --coverage-reporters=html,text,lcov\n\n# Python with pytest\npytest --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-report=term\n\n# Java with Maven\nmvn clean test jacoco:report\n\n# .NET Core\ndotnet test --collect:\"XPlat Code Coverage\"\n```\n\nRemember that 100% coverage is not always the goal - focus on meaningful coverage that actually improves code quality and catches bugs.",
