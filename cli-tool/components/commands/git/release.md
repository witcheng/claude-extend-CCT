# Git Flow Release Branch

Create new release branch: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Current Repository State

- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Git status: !`git status --porcelain`
- Latest tag: !`git describe --tags --abbrev=0 2>/dev/null || echo "No tags found"`
- Commits since last tag: !`git log $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0 2>/dev/null)..HEAD --oneline 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' '`
- Package.json version: !`cat package.json 2>/dev/null | grep '"version"' | head -1 || echo "No package.json found"`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`

## Task

Create a Git Flow release branch following these steps:

### 1. Version Validation

Validate the version format and ensure it's newer than current:

**Version Format Requirements:**
- Must follow semantic versioning: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- Examples: `v1.0.0`, `v2.1.3`, `v0.5.0-beta.1`
- Pattern: `v` + `NUMBER.NUMBER.NUMBER` + optional `-prerelease.NUMBER`

**Version Increment Logic:**

Analyze commits since last tag to suggest version:
- **MAJOR** (v2.0.0): Breaking changes (contains "BREAKING CHANGE:" in commits)
- **MINOR** (v1.3.0): New features (contains "feat:" commits)
- **PATCH** (v1.2.1): Bug fixes only (only "fix:" and "chore:" commits)

**Current Version Analysis:**
```
Latest tag: [from git describe]
Suggested version: [based on commit analysis]
Provided version: $ARGUMENTS
```

If version is invalid or not newer, show:
```
❌ Invalid version format: "$ARGUMENTS"

✅ Use semantic versioning: vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

Examples:
  - v1.0.0 (initial release)
  - v1.2.0 (new features)
  - v1.2.1 (bug fixes)
  - v2.0.0 (breaking changes)
  - v1.0.0-beta.1 (pre-release)

💡 Suggested version based on commits: v1.3.0
```

### 2. Create Release Branch Workflow

```bash
# Switch to develop and update
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create release branch
git checkout -b release/$ARGUMENTS

# Update package.json version (if Node.js project)
npm version ${ARGUMENTS#v} --no-git-tag-version

# Generate CHANGELOG.md from commits
# (analyze git log since last tag)

# Commit version bump
git add package.json CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore(release): bump version to ${ARGUMENTS#v}

- Updated package.json version
- Generated CHANGELOG.md from commits

# Push to remote with tracking
git push -u origin release/$ARGUMENTS
```

### 3. CHANGELOG Generation

```markdown
# Changelog

```

### 6. Error Handling

**No Version Provided:**
```
❌ Version is required

Usage: /release <version>

Examples:
  /release v1.2.0
  /release v2.0.0-beta.1

Current version: v1.1.0
Suggested version: v1.2.0 (based on commits)
```

**Invalid Version Format:**
```
❌ Invalid version format: "1.0"

✅ Correct format: v1.0.0 (must start with 'v')

Examples:
  ✅ v1.0.0
  ✅ v2.1.3
  ✅ v1.0.0-beta.1
  ❌ 1.0.0 (missing 'v')
  ❌ v1.0 (incomplete)
  ❌ version-1.0.0 (wrong format)
```

**Version Not Incremented:**
```
❌ Version $ARGUMENTS is not newer than current v1.2.0

💡 Valid version bumps from v1.2.0:
  - v1.2.1 (patch - bug fixes only)
  - v1.3.0 (minor - new features)
  - v2.0.0 (major - breaking changes)

📊 Commit Analysis:
  - 3 feat: commits → suggests MINOR bump (v1.3.0)
  - 0 BREAKING CHANGE → no MAJOR bump needed
  - 2 fix: commits → could use PATCH (v1.2.1)

Recommended: v1.3.0
```

**Uncommitted Changes:**
```
⚠️  Uncommitted changes detected:
M  src/feature.js
M  README.md

Before creating release:
1. Commit your changes
2. Stash them: git stash
3. Or discard them: git checkout .

Please clean your working directory first.
```

**Develop Behind Remote:**
```
⚠️  Local develop is behind origin/develop by 3 commits

✓ Pulling latest changes...
✓ Fetched 3 commits
✓ Develop is now up to date with remote
✓ Ready to create release branch
```

## Semantic Versioning Guide

**MAJOR version (X.0.0)**: Breaking changes
- API changes that break backward compatibility
- Removal of deprecated features
- Major architectural changes

**MINOR version (1.X.0)**: New features
- New functionality added
- Backward compatible changes
- New APIs or methods

**PATCH version (1.0.X)**: Bug fixes
- Bug fixes only
- No new features
- No breaking changes

## Environment Variables

- `GIT_FLOW_DEVELOP_BRANCH`: Develop branch name (default: "develop")
- `GIT_FLOW_MAIN_BRANCH`: Main branch name (default: "main")
- `GIT_FLOW_PREFIX_RELEASE`: Release prefix (default: "release/")

## Related Commands

- `/finish` - Complete release (merge to main and develop, create tag)
- `/flow-status` - Check current Git Flow status
- `/feature <name>` - Create feature branch
- `/hotfix <name>` - Create hotfix branch

## Best Practices

**DO:**
- ✅ Analyze commits to determine correct version bump
- ✅ Generate comprehensive CHANGELOG
- ✅ Test thoroughly on release branch
- ✅ Keep release branch short-lived
- ✅ Only allow bug fixes on release branch
- ✅ Create PR for team review

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Add new features to release branch
- ❌ Skip testing phase
- ❌ Let release branch live for days
- ❌ Skip CHANGELOG generation
- ❌ Forget to merge back to develop
- ❌ Create releases without team approval
