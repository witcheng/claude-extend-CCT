# Git Flow Status

Display comprehensive Git Flow repository status

## Current Repository State

- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Git status: !`git status --porcelain`
- Branch list: !`git branch -a | grep -E '(feature|release|hotfix|develop|main)' | head -20`
- Latest tags: !`git tag --sort=-version:refname | head -5`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline --graph --all -10`
- Remote status: !`git remote -v`

## Task

Provide a comprehensive Git Flow status report:

### 1. Branch Analysis

Determine current branch type and state:

```bash
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)

# Detect branch type
if [[ $CURRENT_BRANCH == "main" ]]; then
  BRANCH_TYPE="🏠 Production"
  ICON="🏠"
  STATUS_COLOR="red"
elif [[ $CURRENT_BRANCH == "develop" ]]; then
  BRANCH_TYPE="🔀 Integration"
  ICON="🔀"
  STATUS_COLOR="blue"
elif [[ $CURRENT_BRANCH == feature/* ]]; then
  BRANCH_TYPE="🌿 Feature"
  ICON="🌿"
  STATUS_COLOR="green"
elif [[ $CURRENT_BRANCH == release/* ]]; then
  BRANCH_TYPE="🚀 Release"
  ICON="🚀"
  STATUS_COLOR="yellow"
elif [[ $CURRENT_BRANCH == hotfix/* ]]; then
  BRANCH_TYPE="🔥 Hotfix"
  ICON="🔥"
  STATUS_COLOR="red"
else
  BRANCH_TYPE="📁 Other"
  ICON="📁"
  STATUS_COLOR="gray"
fi
```

### 5. Recommendations

Provide actionable recommendations based on status:

```
💡 RECOMMENDATIONS

Priority Actions:
  1. ⚠️  Commit your 3 uncommitted changes
  2. ⚠️  Push 2 unpushed commits to remote
  3. ⚠️  Pull 1 commit from remote (behind)
  4. ℹ️  Run tests before finishing

Branch Hygiene:
  - 2 stale branches can be deleted
  - feature/mobile-app is 2 weeks old (consider splitting)
  - No merge conflicts detected ✓

Next Steps:
  1. Commit changes: git add . && git commit
  2. Pull updates: git pull
  3. Push commits: git push
  4. Run tests: npm test
  5. Finish when ready: /finish
```

### 6. Error States

**Not in Git Repository:**
```
❌ Not in a git repository

Initialize git repository:
  git init
  git remote add origin <url>

Or navigate to a git repository.
```

**No Git Flow Structure:**
```
⚠️  Git Flow structure not detected

Missing branches:
  - develop (integration branch)
